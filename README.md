# AI_Article_Summary

This code is written in JavaScript and uses the React framework to create a single-page web application. The code consists of three files: main.jsx, App.jsx, and App.css. Here's what each file does:

main.jsx: This file is the entry point for the React app. It imports React and ReactDOM libraries, the App component from the App.jsx file, and the Provider component from the react-redux library. It also imports the store object from the store.js file in the services folder. Finally, it uses the ReactDOM.createRoot method to render the App component wrapped in a Provider component and a React.StrictMode component to the root element of the DOM.

App.jsx: This file defines the App component, which is a functional component that returns the JSX for the main content of the web page. It imports the Hero and Demo components from the components folder and the App.css file. The App component returns a main element with two nested div elements. The first div element has a class of main and contains a radial gradient background and a grid background. The second div element has a class of app and contains the Hero and Demo components.

App.css: This file contains the styles for the App component. It includes some styles for the gradient and grid background of the main element and also includes some styles for the Hero and Demo components, such as font size and colors.

Overall, this code creates a simple web page with a gradient and grid background and two components: Hero and Demo. It also uses the redux library to manage state in the application, but the details of this implementation are not shown in the provided code.
